# EJS + Node + Express Learning Project  

⚠️ **Disclaimer**:  
This is purely a **learning project**. It’s not intended for real-world use, production, or deployment.  
I only created this project to **practice and showcase my understanding** of **EJS templating**, **Node.js**, and **Express.js** concepts.  
So… if you came here expecting something useful, you can leave 😅.

## 🎯 Purpose  
The sole purpose of this project is to **learn and demonstrate**:  
- How **EJS templating** works with interpolation syntax.  
- Using **Node.js with Express** to create a simple backend.  
- Basic **routing concepts** in Express.  
- How data can be retrieved, passed to EJS, and dynamically used in templates.  

---

## 🛠️ What I Learned  
- ✅ **EJS Templating** and its interpolation syntax (`<%= %>`, `<% %>`).  
- ✅ How to **set up Node.js with Express**.  
- ✅ Understanding **routing concepts** (GET, POST, and dynamic routes).  
- ✅ How to **retrieve data** from the backend and **pass it to EJS templates** for rendering.

## 🚀 Tech Stack  
- **Node.js**  
- **Express.js**  
- **EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templates)**

## 📌 Note  
This project exists **only for learning purposes** — nothing more, nothing less.
